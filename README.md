# CoverGen RVC

CoverGen RVC is an autonomous pipeline designed to create covers using any RVC v2 trained AI voice from a local audio file. This tool is ideal for developers looking to add singing functionality to their AI assistants, chatbots, or VTubers, and for those who simply want to hear their favorite characters sing their favorite songs.

## Features

- **Inference WebUI**: Easily generate AI covers by selecting a local audio file and applying a trained RVC model. The interface is designed to be intuitive, making the process straightforward even for those new to voice conversion technologies.

- **Model Downloader**: Conveniently download RVC models from within the WebUI. Simply navigate to the "Download Model" tab, paste the download link, and give it a unique name. You can find trained voice models in the [AI Hub Discord](https://discord.gg/aihub). Ensure the downloaded zip file contains the `.pth` model file and optionally, an `.index` file.
